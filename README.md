# Simulation_Of_Epidemic_Using_Agent-Based-Model
Problem: 
The problem is to create efficient and trustworthy simulation models that can correctly forecast the spread of epidemics, help locate potential hotspots, and guide public health policy choices.

Our solution: 
An agent-based model that works with a heterogenous population.
